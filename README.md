# VibrioVulnificus
The Vibrio pipeline was developed under Vibrio project. It contains multiple independent python modules. Stitching-script/Pipeline_Script(f. ex VibVul_Pipeline.sh) can call any of the modules directly in a logical order. The pipeline is being tested and used for studying Vibrio Vulnificus initially. Later it can be forked to use it for other species as well. As the test and experience grows, the code, tools used and the parameters used will also change/evolve. More python modules will be added based on the needs.

config.ini files contains the common parameters for the tools.
